### How to access the editor?

The editor is accessible on each of your books. From the book's dashboard, click on the "edit" icon, it will open a new tab with the editor.

The editor is compatible with all modern web browsers: Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Internet Explore; check that you're using the latest version of your web browser.

### Draft Workflow

The GitBook Editor will trigger a new build each time you save a file (or when you edit the glossary or the summary).

But using the correct workflow, it's possible to work on a draft of your book then build it once it's finished.

1. Create a new branch from the branches menu
    1. Enter a name that describe your modification, for example: "firstdraft"
    2. Select "master" as the origin branch
2. Your active branch should now be the branch that you just created
3. Edit your book like usual
4. When your draft is finish, open the branches menu and click on "Merge Branches"
5. Merge your draft branch into the master branch
6. Delete your old draft branch
7. Done!
